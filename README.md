## FTPEverywhere
Having to launch VitaTweakBox or BGFTP annoyed me. I only turn my Vita's Wi-Fi on when I want to use FTP so I don't have any security issues. Here's an always running background FTP server plugin, like how PS3 CFWs do it. So I edited vitacompanion to take command and logging abilities out and made this.

## Installing the plugin
* Install [QuickMenuReborn](https://github.com/Ibrahim778/QuickMenuReborn) Plugin manualy or via [Autoplugin2](https://github.com/ONElua/AutoPlugin2/releases)
* Add ftpeverywhere.suprx under **QuickMenuReborn** folder in **ur0**

## Using the plugin
This plugin sets up a FTP server on the port 1337. You can connect to it using your FTP client of choice.
If the Wi-Fi connection on your Vita gets interrupted, the FTP server will come back online in some time after the connection is reestablished.

## Plugin Options
- Enable/Disable FTP Server
- Enable/Disable Notifications
